1. Completed Djikstras and BFS as well as test cases for both algorithms/deliverables

2. Tudor set up Djikstras and main for final presentation, Rishi set up BFS, and Elise worked on the Test cases

3. Some reading errors with the test cases set up led to some difficulty as well making sure
to track the vistied nodes correctly to each respective algorithm.

4. Project is finished. Turn it in.
