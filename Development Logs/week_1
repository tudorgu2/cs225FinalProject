1. Set up github repository and discussion plan of action with group for implementing structure and creating files. 
    We realized we needed to add a parsing function that opens the files and reads them into adjacency lists for BFS and Dijkstras

3. Wanted to run in the cs225 container, so setting up the build and CMake took troubleshooting.

4. Begin parsing function to set up dijkstras and BFS
