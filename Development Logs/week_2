1.  Goal was to begin working on the parsing of the files however did not complete
    
2.  Worked together on importing the data set and how we were going to parse, clean, and omit certain datasets

3.  The datalog number order is not correct so we thought of ways to order the dat file (used the indx)

4.  Finish parsing. Begin BFS and Dijkstras
